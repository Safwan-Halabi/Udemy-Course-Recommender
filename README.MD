<h1>This is a simple project about Udemy Courses Search Engine and Recommendation.</h1>

<p>This is a project that shows how a search engine could be implemented using Cosine-Similarity between words, the dataset (csv file) were found on the internet and cleaned by me. 
You can also see metrics and data about various things on the udemy regarding course enrollment.</p>

<p>To run the app simply have all the requirements found in the requirements.txt file in your environment and then run the following command:</p>

<h2>flask --app app run</h2>

<p>flask should then open a new browser tab on your localhost, if it doesnt simply click on the link provided by flask on your command line (usually https://127.0.0.1:5000) </p>

<p>To shutdown the app simply cancel the process in your cmd (usually ctrl+C).</p>
